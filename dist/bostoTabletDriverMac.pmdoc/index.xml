Unfortunately there are no mac drivers. This is my hobby attempt to make a mac driver for the tablet. I've never done a hardware driver before; so this is still a work in progress..

Some things are good:
Fast,
Works with Flash, fireworks, Sketchbook express, Corel Painter, 
works with the operating system, 
works with other paint packages,

Some things are not so good:
No Pressure in corel painter,

And some things just plain suck:
Only tested on Bostom 19mb - I have no idea if it will work on other bosto tablets,
Doesn't work with Adobe Photoshop CS6, or CS5
Does not have any smoothing of pressure or coordinates - this is going to be a deal breaker for most of you : if you draw lines really slowly - you get a lot of "noise" and jitter - in some packages you'll find you get more pressure at the end of your strokes..

What I'm doing about all of this:
Well - I am doing this for free in my (rare) spare time.. I'm Putting up there in the hope that others will help me take it forward - seeing as a lot of the heavy lifting has already been done. If not - I'll chip away at it a bit at a time as time allows.
